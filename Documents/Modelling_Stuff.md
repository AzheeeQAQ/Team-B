The modeled scenes for this game were reconstructed based on MVB(Merchant Venture Building) as a prototype.

All modeling files are in the [model](https://github.com/Jordan-Teaching-Technologist/Team-B/tree/model/model).

## Second floor modelling
The model files are in the [MVB_second_floor](https://github.com/Jordan-Teaching-Technologist/Team-B/tree/model/model/MVB_second_floor).

The second floor is modeled by MVB2.11, Source, corridors, study rooms and toilets, while using horror textures to achieve the effect we wanted for the game.

## First floor modelling
The model files are in the [MVB_first_floor](https://github.com/Jordan-Teaching-Technologist/Team-B/tree/model/model/MVB_first_floor).

The first floor consists mainly of a corridor, and the 1.07 on the first floor was placed by us in the middle of the empty room on the 2nd floor across from the source.

## Character
The model files are in the [character](https://github.com/Jordan-Teaching-Technologist/Team-B/tree/model/model/character).

Our character modeling focuses on the modeling of cheese and its various animations such as walking, jumping and standing.
